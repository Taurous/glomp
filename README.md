# glomp
This is a **work in progress** compiler/interpreter for *glomp*, a concatenative stack-based programming language. This language is inspired by and heavily based on [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) by tsoding. You can find tsoding's playlist where he develops Porth [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4&si=vyidfjAP-EN7_VSV).

## Building
Run the following command in the glomp directory:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
mkdir build/ && /
cd build/ &&  /
cmake .. && /
cd .. && /
=======
mkdir build/ \
cd build/ \
cmake .. \
cd .. \
>>>>>>> 9c25e28935b833945dca391e5ece755f919f6990
cmake --build build/
```

## Running glomp
The glomp compiler/interpreter can be run by calling: `./build/glomp`
